# LLNode-Project
A Project where I familiarized myself with LLNodes and class heirarchies. 
A Trader is an entity that is allowed to trade stock.
A MarketMaker is a specific trader that is needed in order for there to be a market for the given stock.
A BuyLimitOrder is a request to purchase stock.
A SellLimitOrder is a request to sell stock. 
A MarketBuyOrder is a request to purchase stock made specifically by a Market Maker. 
A MarketSellOrder is a request to sell stock made specifically by a Market Maker. 
A Transaction represents the successful trade of a stock. 
A Market uses LLNodes to keep track of the buying and selling of market sell orders and market buy orders for a specific stock. An LLNode class was created specifically
for the purposes of this project and can be found in LLNode.java that is linked in the project.
